# Hyperparameter-Optimization-for-Deep-Q-Networks
Final Project for COMS 6998 Deep Learning Systems Performance at Columbia University <br>

# To-Do
1) Freeze different sets of hyperparameters when using successive halving to figure out the most significant ones. <br>
2) Use hyperband to search for hyperparameters. <br>
3) Clean up notebooks into more uniform code that can be run efficiently. <br>
4) Add a requirements.txt to shorten code & have cleaner output.

## Projection Description
To measure the sensitivity of Deep Q-Networks on different tasks subject to learning rate, batch size, optimizer, target Q network update step size, discount factor, and other hyperparameters to identify the relationship between hyperparameters and efficient convergence to the optimal policy across different state/action regimes.
