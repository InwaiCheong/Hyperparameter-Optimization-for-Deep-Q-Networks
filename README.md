# Hyperparameter-Tuning-for-Deep-Q-Networks
Final Project for COMS 6998 Deep Learning Systems Performance at Columbia University <br>
Collaborator: **Ananth Ravi Kumar**

## Projection Description
To measure the sensitivity of Deep Q-Networks on different tasks subject to learning rate, batch size, optimizer, target Q network update step size, discount factor, and other hyperparameters to identify the relationship between hyperparameters and efficient convergence to the optimal policy across different state/action regimes.

## Implementation
For hyperparameter tuning methods, we implemented random search, successive halving, and bayesian optimizer.
